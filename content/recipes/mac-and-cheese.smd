## Notes

[Source](https://www.momontimeout.com/best-homemade-baked-mac-and-cheese-recipe/)

This is the best mac and cheese we've ever had. Cadence cooked it for the first time 8/31/20 and it was amazing.

Source says you can do other cheese blends. They recommend mozzarella, jack, pepper jack as others that work well.

Source also says panko is better than bread crumbs. The first time we had it was with bread crumbs
