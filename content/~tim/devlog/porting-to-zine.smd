Today I ported my personal website to [zine](https://zine-ssg.io). Inspired by
Loris's [post](https://kristoff.it/blog/critical-social-infrastructure/) about
maintaining a development log, I've decided to try to keep a devlog. I usually
end up sharing things I'm working on in random IRC channels or in the Ghostty
discord...having a centrallized place to share what I'm working on is probably
better than being spammy ðŸ˜‚.

My previous site was built on Hugo, and really only had about 30 family recipes.
It was just a matter of updating the frontmatter, and building a few new layouts
to get it ported over. And also a `post-receive` hook on my VPS to build the
site.
